# Project: dynip-client

Project dynip-client is an example java program to demonstrate the use of asymmetric RSA keys.

This program works in concert with dynip-server, dynip-query.

You can use a browser to query dynip-server as follows: 

Set host, port and protocol as appropriate.
    
        <protocol>://<hostname>:<port>/ipserver/server/ip/query
    
e.g.
    
        https://localhost/ipserver/server/ip/query

or

        http://localhost:8080/ipserver/server/ip/query
     
## Usage

1. Pre-requisites:

    Software:
    
    ```text
    Java 1.9.  
    Gradle 8.0.2.   
    Openssl 3.0.2.
    Linux (Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)).
    ```
    
    Environment:
    
    ```text
    $projectDir must be correctly set - watch for spaces !!!
    ```
    
2. Build:

    Navigate to project home directory and execute the following commands

    ```bash
    cd $projectDir
    ./gradlew clean
    ./gradlew build
    ./gradlew javadoc
    ```
    The build creates a jar located at $projectDir/build/libs/dynip-client.jar

3. Run:

    3.1 Example 1
    
    ```bash
    cd $projectDir/build/libs
    java -jar dynip-client.jar -h
    ```
    output:
    
    ```text

     [-protocol (http|https)] -hostname (ip|domain) [-port <port>] [-uri <path>] -client-private-key <file> -client-public-key <file> -server-public-key <file> -credentials <file> [-debug]
    -protocol:           optional.  set to http or https. default https.
    -hostname:           mandatory. server host. can be an ip address or name.
    -port:               optional.  server port. default 80/443 based on protocol.
    -uri:                optional.  url server endpoint prefix. default '/ipserver/server/ip'.
    -credentials:        mandatory. credentials for server access.
    -client-private-key: optional.  client's private key file. if either private or public client file param is missing, both are generated.
    -client-public-key:  optional.  client's public key file. if either private or public client file param is missing, both are generated.
    -server-public-key:  optional.  server's public key file. if not set it is obtained from server.
    -debug:              optional.  toggle to adjust debug mode. default false.
    ```
    
    3.ii Example 2
    
    ```bash
    cd $projectDir/build/libs
    java -jar dynip-client.jar -protocol http -hostname localhost -port 8180 -credentials ../../src/main/sh/server/credentials -debug
    ```
        
    output:
    
    ```text
    Fri Mar 17 01:34:07 EDT 2023: running
    Fri Mar 17 01:34:07 EDT 2023: configuration
    -protocol:           http
    -hostname:           localhost
    -port:               8180
    -uri:                /ipserver/server/ip
    -credentials:        ../../src/main/sh/server/credentials
    -client-private-key: <generated>
    -client-public-key:  <generated>
    -server-public-key:  <from server>
    -debug:              true
    fini.
    ```

## Credentials

1. Credentials File:

    The credentials file is specified using program parameter -credentials.

    The credentials file has the following format:
    
    ```text
    <user-id>
    <user-password>
    ```
    
    The credentials file must be encrypted before it can be used with this client. 

    The following bash commands can be used to encrypt and decrypt the file

    Decrypt:

    ```bash
    base64 -d credentials.encrypted | \
        openssl pkeyutl -decrypt -inkey $projectDir/src/main/sh/client/client-private.key \
        -keyform PEM -pkeyopt rsa_padding_mode:pkcs1 
    ```
    
    Encrypt:
    
    ```bash
    openssl pkeyutl -encrypt -pubin -inkey $projectDir/src/main/sh/client/client-public.key \ 
        -in credentials.plaintext -keyform PEM -pkeyopt rsa_padding_mode:pkcs1 | \
        base64 | tr -d "\n" > credentials.encrypted
    ```
    
## Asymmetric Keys

1. Key Generation

    The following commands are used to generate private and public keys.
    
    Server:
    
    ```bash
    openssl genpkey -out server-private.key -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:4096
    openssl rsa -pubout -outform pem -in server-private.key -out server-public.key
    ```
    
    The server private key "server-private.key" should be configured in the dynip-server inatance for this client.
    
    Client:
    
    ```bash
    openssl genpkey -out client-private.key -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:4096
    openssl rsa -pubout -outform pem -in client-private.key -out client-public.key 
    ```

## User credentials 

NOTE: user credentials are no longer encrypted on the client. Following notes are left in nonetheless.

1. Credentials
   
    This is a demo program so credentials are just to prevent abuse and other than that are placeholder standard only.

    Credentials are stored on the client encrypted by the client's public key.

    The client decrypts these and then re-encrypts the plaintext user/password pair using the server's public key.

    The final encrypted value is sent to the server along with the rest of the message payload.

    The plaintext value of the credentials file is as follows

    ```text
    user
    password
    ```

    e.g.

    ```text
    smith
    bananas
    ```

    The command to encrypt the client credentials is as follows.

    ```bash
    openssl rsautl -encrypt -pubin -inkey client-public.key -in plaintext.txt | base64 > encrypted.txt
    ```

    you can see the binary format before base64 encoding by running

    ```bash
    openssl rsautl -encrypt -pubin -inkey client-public.key -in plaintext.txt > encrypted.txt
    ```
